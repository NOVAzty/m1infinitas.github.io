            M1∞ (M1 Infinitas) is a fluid, interdisciplinary art collective committed to dismantling boundaries between disciplines.
            We work across various media and perspectives, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration and experimental creation.
        </p>
        <p>
            M1∞ emphasizes openness and generativity. Our members come from diverse backgrounds, including such as music, theater,
            visual arts, industrial design, technology, and the humanities. Rather than following fixed frameworks, our projects
            evolve dynamically around concepts, continuously shifting through the interplay of creation and research in response
            to the progression of contemporary art and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            The collective engages with any topic worth exploring, unconstrained by medium, form, or domain. Our practice points
            toward the possibility of rethinking—staying open in the process of constant emergence, embracing uncertainty, and
            welcoming new narratives, perspectives, and collaborations as we explore the unknown edges together.
